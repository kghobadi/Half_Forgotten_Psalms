Kalamari Desert Train from Mario Kart 64

Model and all textures made from scratch by Peardian using Cinema 4D and Fireworks.


Info:
I made this for the sake of my Mario kart 64 maps back in 2010.
The models are presented in their original condition with only minor changes for the conversion process.
